# 1. You have 10 questions to answer
# 2. You will have 30 seconds to answer each question
# 3. When your 30 seconds are up it will tell you if you       got it correct or incorrect for 5 seconds then move       on to the next question where the 30 second timer         will reset.
# 4. At the end of the game you will be presented with         the results which include the number of Correct,          Incorrect, and Unanswered questions.
# 5. You will also have the option to play the same set        of questions again with the same rules as above
